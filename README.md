# PHYSIX_Utils

Repository for all usefull scripts and codes for the PHYSIX team of IMPMC

Contains:
- GPlib: A small C++ library that can do most of the data analysis for most codes used in molecular dynamics, plus a few other AI calculations
- LAMMPS: Set of codes (Fortran, Julia, Bash) that were used to do specific pre/post-processing for simulations with LAMMPS
- Gromacs: Set of codes (Fortran & Bash) that were used to do specific pre/post-processing for simulations with GROMACS
- QE : Same thing as above for Quantum Espresso, also most of it is in Julia.
- Map : Set of codes to do PIV-based maps (PIV: Permutation Invariant Vector)

This project is very much ongoing...

Current participants:
- Fabio Pietrucci, Assistant Professor
- Mathieu Moog aka "CondensedOtters" , 2nd year PHD student
