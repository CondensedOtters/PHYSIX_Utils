\section{Compilation}
  Compiling should be straightforward  with \texttt{gfortran} and \texttt{openmpi}:
  just \texttt{make} in the directory where you decompressed piv\_clustering\_1.3.tar.gz.
  In case you want to compile a serial version (not parallel), modify the file \texttt{makefile} by removing the flag
  \texttt{-DMPI} and replacing \texttt{mpif90} with \texttt{gfortran}.
  Other compiling schemes have not been tested extensively.

\section{Input}
  The clustering program currently analyzes trajectories written in the formats xyz and pdb.
  In the case of xyz files, only orthorombic simulation boxes are supported, with fixed $a\ b\ c$ sides.
  In the case of pdb files, triclinic cells are allowed, and the parameters $a\ b\ c\ \alpha\ \beta\ \gamma$ 
  are specified for each frame, so that variable cells can be employed
  (note that there was a bug in version 1.2, fixed in version 1.3). 
  All details about file formats 
  are discussed in Section 3. Starting from the atomic coordinates, a Permutation Invariant Vector (PIV)
  is constructed for each trajectory frame, and the matrix of distances between all pairs of PIVs is computed.
  Frames are then clusterized into disjoint sets employing different algorithms.

  Executing \texttt{./piv\_clustering.x} will print the following tips:

                                       {\color{green}optional}. You should specify this only if you do not want to 
                                       sort the PIV, i.e.,  you do not want the magic of our method at work.
  \item[\texttt{-restart\_piv} ]\hfill\\
                                       {\color{green}optional}. Reads back the PIV from \texttt{PIV\_CORE.*}
                                       files rather than computing them. You need to have the same number of cores
                                       reading them than when you first wrote them. This option is meaningless 
                                       if \texttt{restart\_matrix} is specified.
  \item[\texttt{-restart\_matrix}   ]\hfill\\

                                       distance matrix from the file \texttt{FRAME\_TO\_FRAME.MATRIX} rather than
                                       computing it from the PIV. This option is very useful since computing
                                       this matrix is the most expensive part of the calculation.

                                       {\color{red}required}. Can be either 1 or $>1$: in the former case, Daura's algorithm
                                       \cite{daura} is employed to cluster the data. In the latter, kmedoids \cite{kmedoids}
                                       with k-means++ initialization \cite{kmeans} is employed and the number
                                       is the desired number of clusters.

                                       {\color{red}required} (only for \texttt{-algorithm 1}). Specifies the cutoff (in PIV units) for Daura's 
                                       clustering algorithm \cite{daura}. To have a clue about reasonable values, check the average and maximum
                                       distance between frames as printed in the output of the program.
  \item[\texttt{-cutoff\_clcoeff}   ]\hfill\\
                                       {\color{green}optional}. Specifies a cutoff (in PIV units) to define when two members of a cluster are
                                       neighbor. Used only for computing the clustering coefficient.
  \item[\texttt{-network\_analysis} ]\hfill\\
                                       {\color{green}optional}. Generates a map of the cluster centers in \texttt{svg} format.

                                       {\color{green}optional}. Writes the radial distribution function g(r) and the number of atoms

\section{Trajectory file formats}

As a general remark, the program identifies identical atoms as those that have the same symbol in the trajectory file. 
Identical atoms are considered indistinguishable, thus thay can be exchanged without changing the physical properties of the system.
Therefore, if for some reason you want to keep two atoms of the same element as distinguishable, label them with different symbols in the 
trajectory file, e.g., C1 and C2 instead of C and C.

BEWARE: each frame in the trajectory file must have the same sequence of chemical elements, otherwise the program will print
incorrect results. 
In other words, a configuration with sequence "O O O H H H H H H" cannot be compared with "O H H O H H O H H"; chemical elements 
must match in all frames.

According to the official pdb format (\texttt{http://www.wwpdb.org/docs.html}) the record \texttt{CRYST1}
contains at columns 7-54 the $a\ b\ c\ \alpha\ \beta\ \gamma$ cell parameters,
where $\alpha$ is the angle (in degrees) between vectors \textbf{b} and \textbf{c},
$\beta$ between \textbf{a} and \textbf{c}, and $\gamma$ between \textbf{a} and \textbf{b}.
The record \texttt{MODEL} contains a comment.
The record \texttt{ATOM} contains the atom symbol at columns 13-16, and the Cartesian coordinates at columns 31-54; additional

Each frame begins with a line containing the number of atoms, followed by a comment line, followed by a line per atom
containing the atom symbol and the Cartesian coordinates. Contrary to the pdb format, there are no predefined column ranges.
The cell parameters are fixed and provided as a command line input with \texttt{-bsize}.

\section{Example}
  Here below is a simple example for testing purposes, in directory \texttt{test}. 

  The trajectory \texttt{traj-ice-melting.xyz} is taken from a simulation of ice at 320K
  (64 water molecules, TIP4P potential). The ice starts melting at around step 70.
  If you did not compile the mpi version of the code, remove "mpirun -np 4" from the commands below.
  First, try to execute the commands in file \texttt{run1} (Daura's clustering algorithm):
  \begin{verbatim}
mpirun -np 4 ../piv_clustering.x -filexyz traj-ice-melting.xyz -bsize 12.8 12.8 12.8 \ 
-method 2 -coord1_param 2.6 0.6 -algorithm 1 -cutoff_daura 1.2 &> log1
  \end{verbatim}
  Two clusters will be found, and you should obtain a similar output as in directory \texttt{test/check1}. 
  The calculation should require a few seconds.

  Afterwards, you can restart the distance matrix in file \texttt{FRAME\_TO\_FRAME.MATRIX} (very quick, especially in the case of large trajectories) 
  and try instead the k-medoids algorithm with 2 clusters:
  \begin{verbatim}
mpirun -np 4 ../piv_clustering.x -filexyz traj-ice-melting.xyz -bsize 12.8 12.8 12.8 \
-method 2 -coord1_param 2.6 0.6 -algorithm 2 -restart_matrix &> log2
  \end{verbatim}
  Note: keep in mind that the k-means++ initialization of the k-medoids algorithm is based on random numbers, 
  therefore the clustering results may differ repeating the same command: test several times to 
  ensure that results are robust.
  In particular, your result may differ from those in directory \texttt{test/check2}.
  Daura's algorithm instead is reproducible, but does not allow to specify in advance the desired number of clusters.
