**Analysis of Solvated Glycine**

This projects consisted in trying to expand the various analysis tools created for the study of geothermal CO<sub>2</sub> on a different system, a glycine molecule solvated in water.

The goal was therefore more to test whether the validity of the tools developped for geothermal CO<sub>2</sub> could be applied to other chemical systems.
