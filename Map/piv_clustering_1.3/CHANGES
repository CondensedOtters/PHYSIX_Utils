    Changes from version 1.2 to 1.3:

* Fixed a bug in the calculation of distances with non-orthorombic cells 
  (pdb format).
* Fixed a bug in cluster*xyz files, and changed slightly their format.
* Added an option to print out the radial distribution function.
* Switched from 4-bytes to 2-bytes representation of PIV by default.
* Sorting of PIV is based on counting_sort instead of quicksort (50x faster!).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Changes from version 1.1 to 1.2:

* Added the possibility of reading pdb files with cell that varies from frame
  to frame (even triclinic).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Changes from version 1.0 to 1.1:

* A bug is fixed for the combined use of SPRINT coordinates with the Fermi-Dirac 
  coordination function.
