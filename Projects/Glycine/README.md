** Analysis of Solvated Glycine **

This projects consisted in trying to expand the various analysis tools created for the study of geothermal CO$_2$ on a different system, a glycine molecule solvated in water.

The goal was therefore more to test whether the validity of the tools developped for geothermal CO$_2$ could be applied to other chemical systems.
