Contains:
- GPlib: library containing general codes to make easy analysis of AI,MD,AIMD simulations written in several languages: Julia, Fortran, C++, Python (quality varies widely with languages)
- Projects: codes that were used in the analysis of projects within the PHYSIX team, can be used as examples to built new analysis codes
- Softwares: contains sets of useful codes for MD and AIMD softwares (GROMACS, CPMD, CP2K, QE, etc...) built with GPlib
- Supercomputers: Examples of job scripts and compilation recipies and general advises for Supercomputers
