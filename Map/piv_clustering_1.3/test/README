The trajectory traj-ice-melting.xyz is taken from a simulation of ice at 320K
(64 water molecules, TIP4P potential). The ice starts melting at around step 70.

Try to run the scripts run1 and run2 and compare the results with those in 
directories check1 and check2.

* if you did not compile the mpi version of the code, remove "mpirun -np 4".
* run2 reads the file FRAME_TO_FRAME.MATRIX generated by run1.
